### Hello, My name is Gawain 

I bring 19 years of experience as a freelance creative working with communities, businesses, voluntary organisations and private clients, developing technologies and driving innovation in music and art.

After years of self directed learning I recently completed the Makers Academy bootcamp to refine my practice. I am a big believer in test driven development and pair programming, and I like to write code that is easy to read and easy to change.
