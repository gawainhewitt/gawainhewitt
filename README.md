### Hello, My name is Gawain 

I bring 19 years of experience as a freelance creative working with communities, businesses, voluntary organisations and private clients, developing technologies and driving innovation in music and art.

I write software that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change and I recently completed the Makers Academy bootcamp to refine my practice. I am a big believer in test driven development and pair programming, and love to work in teams.
